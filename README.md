One of the most alarming issues in modern cities is the air quality level, where air pollution has caused 120 deaths out of 100,000 per year based on a worldwide study (Green Car Congress, 2019). The World Health Organization emphasized that 97% of cities in low- and middle- income countries with more than 100 000 inhabitants do not meet World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines. Due to poor air quality, it will increase potential health risks such as risk of stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, asthma and others as well (citation). Hence, there is a need to install an air quality monitoring system in cities to ensure the air is not contaminated. This can be done by installing sensors to monitor dust particles, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide levels and this information can be shared with the public through smartphones, where the smartphone app allows people to monitor real-time data of the current air quality level in the area. Hence, through these implementations, better quality of life can be achieved.
